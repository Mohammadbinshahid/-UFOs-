## Summary: 

The page designed is user friendly however the users will have to go through the complete data to find out what cities/states/date etc to search for. A more ideal page would have a drop down menu which presents filters for years / months /date for all sightings. Similar would be the case for the list of cities / states. A drop down meny gives the user the option to select rather than search through the complete data and apply filters.
