# -UFOs-

## Overview of Project: 
### Purpose
To build a dynamic webpage that adjusts to user inputs to display information about UFO sightings. Users should be able to filter data according to date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results: 

This is the initial page, users can navigate through the page by using one or multiple filter criteria


#Webpage filtered by Date


#Webpage filtered by City - Lemon grove


#Webpage filtered by State - Florida


#Webpage filtered by State and Country- New York and US


## Summary: 

The page designed is user friendly however the users will have to go through the complete data to find out what cities/states/date etc to search for. A more ideal page would have a drop down menu which presents filters for years / months /date for all sightings. Similar would be the case for the list of cities / states. A drop down meny gives the user the option to select rather than search through the complete data and apply filters.
